The following project is a project completed as an assignment.
My personal goal was to develop a file transfer system based on a client-server architecture.

The following is a console application using socket technology and custom made communication protocol.
The intended purpose of application was to allow transfer of files through network, though final version of the application was tested only using localhost for simplicity.
